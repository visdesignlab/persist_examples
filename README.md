# Persist Example

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/visdesignlab/persist_examples/HEAD)

This repository contains examples of use for the [persist]() library.  Persist is a JupyterLab extension to enable persistent interactive visualizations in JupyterLab notebooks.


To use the extension you will need Vega-Altair and JupyterLab. You can install the extension directly from pip using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installation is successful, you can start Jupyter Lab as usual by running the command in this directory:

```bash
jupyter-lab
```
