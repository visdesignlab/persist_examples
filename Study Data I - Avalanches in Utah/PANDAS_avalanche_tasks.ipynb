Partner bailed but still went out today with the intent of exploring around Catherine's Pass just to take a look and take one ride out using the low angle terrain near the trail to the pass to get back down to the meadow. Started at 12:30 and got to the pass at 3:00. Since it stopped snowing and began to clear, decided to skin up to the ridgeline for a better view.  Dug 3 pits, one prior in the meadow just for curiosity\\u2019s sake, another along the ridge and another towards what I believed to be the top of the run \\u2018so long\\u2019.  After these assessments, it was apparent riding any of these open slopes could be a bad play. By the time I was at what I perceived to be \\u2018so long\\u2019 it was snowing pretty well again and the fatigue that had set in had begun to cloud my judgment. Instead of taking the time to simply use my own skin track back to the meadow, figured I could save time and energy by riding or just hiking down the spine. (Looker\\u2019s right of 'so long' utilizing all the trees as anchors.) \\r\\n\\r\\nAs I started down, I didn\\u2019t locate the specific trees I had seen several times before and then realized I was not near so long but actually on sunset, which starts out at even lower angle but has a short, steep section for what I believe was about 20-30 yards to get to the meadow. Attempted 3 turns to release any sluff which it did and released a good bit of snow to my right. So had let that pass and attempted to change direction to exit to my left by crossing the slope and once I did, it released about 5 or so yards above me and was easily able to stop and let the snow pass without issue. \\r\\n\\r\\nTook only one photo which is attached and surprised how far it had continued to my left. Again, a bad estimate on distance but would guess 60-80 yards? Rode down to the meadow and out but think about the following mistakes. (1) Should have never been on that north facing slope, especially being well aware of the advisory and previous snow still in place, (2) solo, (3) deviated from original plan, (4) used fatigue and time constraints as an excuse to not backtrack safely, (5) knowingly going into a short, but potential terrain trap, (6) changing direction after releasing the sluff. \\r\\n\\r\\nThought it was important to report and get the appropriate feedback. \\r\\n\\r\\nForecaster Comments:  Excellent perspective on the event.

One other person used it up to Catherine pass.  We did not drop in until the other user was at the pass.  We kept our slope angle low and identified safe spots.  We had good visibility, the run out zone was clear should an avalanche happen.  We thought we would kick a slide off, but we were a bit surprised to see how well the soft slab was connected.  With hard slab failure it is not uncommon to see crowns travel long distances through non uniform terrain, soft slabs however not so much in non uniform terrain.  The snow felt right side up, no wind effect, 4 finger to fist resistance, not very supportable, we could barely make turns on the low angle slope we skied.

I was deliberately ski cutting the top of this slope when a 10' wide, 1' deep, very soft slab released at my feet, running into the choke of the gully below me.  Below the narrowest portion of this slope, the weight of the debris released a wider avalanche below cliff bands on either side of the narrows.  On the skier's right side of this sympathetic release, the slab failed in pooled graupel that likely accumulated during one of the graupel events in the latter half of this week, and the crown in this portion of the slide was about 16 inches deep; on the skiers left side, a 20-foot wide, 2' soft slab failed on the faceted snow that sat atop the snowpack for several weeks in mid/late November.  The debris from this slide entrained quite a bit of snow, ran until the slope angle decreased significantly, and could have buried a person.  Although it was a crowded day in Silver/Days, nobody was in the area when this slide occurred.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis slide occurred during what was likely the peak of instability during a day of moderate-heavy snowfall.  Several density changes were noted throughout the day, with heavily rimed flakes and clean, angular stellars falling in consecutive periods.  What initially seemed like a short, manageable portion of complex terrain worth navigating in order to harvest the pow-pow below, was in immediate hindsight a perfect spot to activate a couple of distinct buried weak layers.  The \\\"November Facets,\\\" which have lacked a sufficient load to propagate clean shears in snowpit tests, showed their potential with the help of significant shock-loading, and I would not be surprised if additional snow-n-blow overnight makes avalanches failing on this layer-as well as wind slabs and storm snow avalanches failing on buried graupel or various crusts-easier to trigger tommorow.  I would consider midslope terrain features, on NW-N-NE facing slopes above about 10,000', which may have been sheltered during recent wind/rain events, to be most suspicious for possible persistent slab avalanches.\\r\\n\\r\\nI reported this slide to Alta Central, and it was in turn reported to the UAC, as a 1' deep, 50 foot wide avalanche.

Conditions on the skin track were fine in the shade, but upon hitting anything in the sun the snow was wet and very sticky.  We did notice a light melt freeze crust in the trees below about 8000 feet presumably from greenhousing.  The mid elevation snow on the north side of the compass seemed great.  After gaining the ridge and seeing pretty significant cornices we decided to cut one to check stability. We were the only party on the skin track up to that point and felt comfortable that no one would be approaching in the area below.  Unable to get anything sizeable to drop from the first cornice without exposing ourselves, we moved on to another more overhanging cornice up the ridge.  Of note with the first cornice, we did remark that the snow surface the smaller chunks landed on did not seem too deep, perhaps a wind slab with some new snow on top.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe second cornice provided a definative result.  Upon dislodging a chunk in the 300-400 lb. range the slope below avalanched.  The avalanche was interesting in a couple ways.  It was obviously a slope that had been wind loaded, and the intitial fracture looked to be a thick wind slab 1-2.5 feet.  As the slide ran, it looked to dig into the older snow (facets) exposing logs and rocks.  My best guess is that this slope has slid earlier this season leaving a thinner snowpack and well developed facets that the new snow was on top of, but due to hangfire I was not comfortable getting onto the bed surface.  I was able to get close to the toe of the slide, but have already seen what the slope was capable of, it didn't feel the need to explore too much.  The debrie pile was spread out over a 28-29 degree slope about 1-3 ft deep.  Overall the slide was small and probably would not fully bury a person, but the energy and terrain could most certaintly cause severe trauma.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a slope that we were comfortable skiing today before the slide and had in fact sought out due to its elevation and aspect.  I feel that there is a decent chance that if we just dropped the slope we would not have gotten it to slide under the weight of a person.  For myself and my partners today, this is a great learing experience.  By the forecast alone this slope would have fallen into the low category today.  Upon looking at the more sublte signs before going for the center punch we were able to discover a more complex situtation.

In Maybird, Hogum, and Coalpit Gulch, storm totals since wednesday seem to mirror ski resort study plot data from the upper cottonwoods, with up to a couple feet of light density snow sitting atop the nuclear MF crust from last weekend.  Winds were calm from the NW all day, with sun shining through the low cloud deck occaisionally, but not enough to cause significant wet activity, at least in the higher elevations.  SE-S-W will likely have a slight crust tomorrow.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOnly two significant avalanches were obvious today, in places where you'd expect to see some activity during a windy snowstorm.  Most interesting was a long running, soft-slab avalanche originating in the alluvial feature beneath, and lookers right, of the choke of the upper chute in the Hypodermic Needle--just below where skiers commonly traverse out of the needle and onto the ridgeline between the Coalpit Headwall and the Needle.  This avalanche failed on light density snow from wednesday, 3/20, which sits atop a pencil hard, brown MF crust, and just beneath a 2 inch deep, 1F slab of graupel from thursday morning, 3/21.  Much of the crown was blown in, but a small portion was still exposed, and my best guess is that this slide ran during or just after the period of high precipitation intensity on 3/21.  Debris ran to within a few hundred feet of the creek in Hogum fork, and was covered by new snow from the last few days, and I'd call it a D2.5--your Hummer would have been totaled, but it would still resemble a Hummer.  Debris was still soft underneath ~10\\\" of new snow, which corroborates my impression that the slide occurred early in this storm cycle.  Another large slide occured in the eastern-most slide path on the coalpit headwall, with impressive deposition apparent ~1500' below the ridgeline.  \\r\\n\\r\\nNo other obvious slides in outer-LCC today, although it is a hoot to see the wet-slide carnage from last weekend just barely obscured by our new snow.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince thursday, 3/21, I've found the MF crust/stellars/graupel slab combination to continue to be sensitive, with quick snowpits, ski cuts, and cornice drops showing failure propagation in this layering is still possible.

The initial weak layer was one to two inches above the old snow/new snow interface, and then it appeared to step down to the old snow/melt freeze crust. The weak layer was a light density layer in the new snow, directly above the interface. There was some bonding to the old snow, and this appeared to be a result of the warmth in the old snow surface. Interestingly, there were facets on top of the old snow surface on the highest starting zones in the NNE facing Rocky Points Main chutes. These facets were up to 1mm\\u00a0and were showing signs of rounding. Also, the old snow surface crust in this area was 1 to 2 inches deep and there were moderate sized facets below this crust; and this weakness was just one of three layers that were cracking. \\u00a0Widespread cracking and collapsing was occurring on all slopes with angles > 30 degrees. Slopes between 30 and 35 degrees were cracking and not moving. All slopes with angles > 35 degrees were either already cleaned out or cracking, and very sensitive and easy to initiate activity. The cracking layers were 4 to 8 inches down, as well as at the old snow surface.

These were triggered by very small cornice drops, walking slope cuts, and gentle stomping on the ridgeline. The snow was very sensitive. Propagation was quick and widespread in this area. The snow that was active was all areas that received loading from the NW winds but had not gotten thick with wind loading. The slabs were all soft slabs and the deepest crown face was 11 inches with the majority of crown faces around 8 inches.

The conditions on that aspect were about 5 inches of new snow on top of a solid and slick sun crust.    As my wife descended first she initiated a small point release behind her which looked like minor sloughing of the new snow on top of the sun crust.  It moved pretty slowly (never more than 10-15 mph max) but started to get wider and pick up more and more snow.  It eventually caught up to her when she stopped and carried her for about 50 feet until she grabbed a small tree and it continued (still slowly) another couple hundred feet.  The whole thing probably lasted more than a minute and carved all the new snow off the slope down to the sun crust.  It never moved quickly or violently and didn't seem like it would have buried anybody but it would not have been pleasant had it pulled anyone over a cliff or other hazard.  In retrospect we underestimated how fast the sun and rapidly warming temperatures were changing the snow conditions.  We also could have chosen any number of less direct return routes to the car that would not have been nearly as susceptible to this type of activity which was clearly predicted in the morning avalanche advisory.

We hadn't seen any instabilities and knew the winds had been blowing per the avie report and what we saw as the sun came up while on top of Silver Fork/Honeycomb Ridge.   While skinning up into West Bowl I was breaking trail and pulled over to let another lead out, noticing that there was a graupel layer about 4-5\\\" down. When rejoining the skin track there were small pieces of slab that slid on this graupel layer onto the skin track below me which I should have kept in mind later in our tour. Mistake #1.   As we neared the top of West Bowl, one of our party suggested holding up as the other two went to the top and he would take some photos as we descended into west bowl with Alta in the background. As we skinned up to the top I thought it best to descent skiers left of the existing tracks, but then focusing more on the photos decided to ski to the skiers right of the summit along the ridgeline and then drop in allowing for a better photo. Mistake #2.  I pushed off and made a couple of turns along the ridge gaining some speed and made my third turn to the right along the ridge/cornice edge which was more rounded in this spot. Exiting this turn and making the next turn to my left into the main part of the bowl I looked out ahead and saw what in a split second looked like a skin track but then clearly looked like a large ripple. I then realized the snow around me was rippling up and looking over my shoulder saw I was in the middle of a slide that had broken at the top of ridge where my third turn was. Fortunately I was carrying enough speed to maintain a trajectory across the slide and exit to the skiers left as the slab and other snow was carried another 200' down slope clipping the edge of the pines in West Bowl.  Luckily for me the slide was only 60' wide and at most 12\\\" deep which likely wouldn't have completely buried me given it didn't entrain more snow but I easily could have been knocked down and strained through the pines.

I made two mistakes and after thinking about I can look back and learn.  I remember when  skinning up last Friday and I was looking at the big snow crystals on the top of the snow (surface hoar) and made the comment that this could be a weak layer come next storm.  Had powder fever and totally forgot all about that observation when I headed up.  I also made the classic mistake of seeing many tracks and assuming that sincemany people had skied it that its not going to slide.  So me and my partner rode the first pitch, one at a time, with no problems.  Same line we all took off the cornice and down to the flat section last Friday.  Last time I rode that line I went skiers right of that flat section and into the main chute, however me and my partner decided to stay in the trees since that was where the best snow was.  I started the second pitch and about my third turn snow was fracturing all around me.  The fracture shot out about 15 ft to my left and about 50 feet to my right.  I carved a hard left and was eventually able to get out to the side of it.  I shouted out \\\"AVALANCHE\\\" for my partner and put the avalung in my mouth as I made the desperate carve to the left.  Another thing that kinda freaked me out was the slide started in the glade within the trees and spread out to some thick tree sections of the bowl. Slab was about 75-100 feet wide and about 14 inches thick and ran for a hundred yards.  I always kinda assume that trees were a safer choice, not last night.  My theory is that the sun was out all day and got kinda warm.  Even though those trees did not see any direct sun it got warm enough to consolidate that new snow layer into a thick slab.  The cold nights really built up some surface hoar in those sheltered tree zones making a weak layer that was not found in the main chute.  The main avalanche chute had enough daytime sun to keep those weak crystals building up actually making the gut a safer choice.

The debris appeared to have stopped mostly at the bench around 9700', but it looked like some debris ran into the gully far below.

Right where/when spotter C said to 'stop' the cornice released between A and B's feet. Luckily both stepped back onto the ridge. The cornice was about 20 feet wide, perhaps 10 feet out. It triggered another 200+ foot wide avalanche on the east face of Mt Nebo (it was very hard to see just how far the new crown propagated due to our extreme hesitation to get too close to the edge).

Slopes steep enough to slide are VERY touchy right now.  All it took was a 50lb chunk of snow tumbling a couple times to trigger a large violent avalanche with very high likely un-survivable consequences if caught.

Only 2 of us  were caught in the slide.   No one was partially buried and no one  required assistance to become  unburied.  The two caught in the slide  self rescued via death grip on a  tree.  All four people in the group  have had avalanche training.  We  also knew that this avalanche cycle is  one of the worst ever.  It is  true we didnt have our avy gear with us.   So yes we did f*@# up in that  aspect, but beacons and shovels wouldnt  have saved me or my buddy if  we had gone much further down the slide  path because those trees and  cliffs would have smashed the life out of  us,\\r\\nThe group did not intend to ski into Hidden Canyon, we were traversing   when the avy hit.  Our plan was to traverse above the chutes and ski the   ridge line between Lack-o-waxen and Hidden Canyon with the ultimate   goal of skiing some low angle trees off of 10420.\\r\\nLooking back at what we did wrong, and I know from everyone out there that this is a long list so I won't hit on the obvious.\\r\\nFirst , we should have hiked straight up Claytons Peak from the chair   lift and then we would have been on the ridge line without having to   traverse above Brown Spot (The Hidden Canyon Headwall).\\r\\nSecond, as crazy as this sounds If i had been on skis, I believe this   slide would not have happened.  Because, as we traversed above the   chutes the skier in our group was able to maintain a high traverse and   was safely above the crown.  The slide was triggered when 2 of us   (snowboarders) stopped together at a spot way too low off the ridge.\\r\\nThirdly,  our spacing on the traverse was really bad. when the 2 of us   stopped next to each other the weight of both of us together triggered   the slide.\\r\\nOriginal report:\\r\\nBrighton Patrol received report of a avalanche in the Hidden Canyon sidecountry area around 11AM.

Skier A dropped first staying in the same area as the two tracks and the skin track. Skier B dropped the same area. Both skiers then skinned back up the existing skin track. About 30 feet from the ridgeline skier B decided to dig a pit so skier A made his way up towards the ridge to a safe spot. Skier B then traversed out from the skin track and onto slightly steeper slope to dig a pit. Skier B had enough time to take his skis off and get his shovel and saw out before a 2.5' slab broke about 20 feet above him and propagated 150' to the south. Skier B struggled to run up the slab and get out but was not able to escape. Skier B took a ride to the bottom of the slope. Luckily ending up on top and uninjured.

Its always good, and Thanks is always given, when you come back from a day of riding with your sled in one piece and everyone is safe. This day extra Thanks was given.

I like climbing here because it has a large run-out and options for the worst case scenario's. I am glad I had extra power (12 lbs boost) and was able to climb out above it. Not a fun filling when the ground starts moving on you. It broke 30' above me and I was able to climb to what I thought was safety above the slide. I got nervous (more nervous) above where it broke, because I thought out of the corner of my eye I saw another fracture and I didn't have the speed to climb out of that one. So, I turned and went down and deployed my airbag. BTW I have always thought it would be hard to pull the handle while riding and having to let go of the handle bars. It took all of .1 seconds to reach and grab and pull and then hammer down. Now I came down with the worry of not knowing what was following behind me. Got to the bottom and I was now moving fast, 60+ mph, and realized there is a big pile of snow at the bottom and I am now going airborne. Squared up the best I could and took some air off a 5' slab kicker! Got some air and landed hard but I was know out of the danger zone. I am very grateful that nobody was hurt. I didn't need to deploy the bag, but its better to be safe than sorry. Interested point. I got to the bottom and thought, \\\"stupid airbag didn't event deploy.\\\" I really couldn't even tell that it was out and it didn't impede my riding or ability to ride fast and jump some technical spots. Took all of 5 min to pack it back up. Thanks to SNOWBIGDEAL and getting me a refill tank the next day for $35. We inspected the slide after and apparently what I thought was another fracture above me was a set off coyotes tracks traversing horizontally across the top.

We were on the sub-peak of reynolds directly to the east of the summit. We planned to ride back down along the spine of the ridge between the south and east facing slopes but stopped to dig a pit just for a bit of education of how the main face was most likely set up. We found the full gamut of layers, with significant failures on an isolated block on some depth hoar about 3 feet down, as well as some lighter failures at the top of the more dense snow  from earlier this week (most likely wind slab, which was found about 2 feet down) and just above a melt-freeze crust about 4 feet down. Once we finished up with the pit I began to descend directly down the spine of the ridge, along the border of the trees. About 5 turns down, I dropped about 2 feet off to skiers right (onto the south face) to get around a tree and stopped to wait for my partner. At this point I noticed a very large sympathetic slide running, at about 100-200 feet into the slope from where I had just skied. It looked to be about 200-300 ft wide at the widest point of propagation, with highly variable crown that was anywhere from centimeters to 2.5-3 ft deep to my eye. It ran down through the trees and the full length of the slide path, into the valley below the peak. It looked to be a soft slab, with several large blocks of the crown dispersed around the starting point. I suspect it failed somewhere in the wind slabs that we had noticed before.   Glad I've honed in my skills enough to know that that slope was sure to slide, this certainly confirmed that hunch. Great turns were had on safer, lower aspect skiing all around Reynolds. Let me know if you have any further questions!

I was about ten turns in when I saw a crack appear underneath my skis; by the next turn, I could see the southern flank of the slab pulling out from a steeper, more northerly terrain feature, about 100 feet to my left and 200 feet downslope.  The slide ran into a dense aspen grove, audibly snapping trees up to four inches in diameter.  My group of three used the gentle ridge on the N side of this terrain feature to descend, following our skin-track, and we were able to access the debris, making sure there was no evidence other people had been in the runout.  We did not approach the crown of this slide.   We made a few serious mistakes yesterday.  First, we ignored, or failed to take seriously, obvious signs of instability.  Along the ridge, we felt a couple relatively small, isolated collapses; we told each other they seemed like they were coming from underneath obvious wind drifts, which themselves were covered in roughly 10 inches of light density, settled, deceptively un-wind-affected snow.  Furthermore, we could not see obvious signs of recent avalanches in lower and middle Mineral Fork, although clouds obscured the Room of Doom all morning.  At a location where the slope measured 30 degrees and an altimeter read 8300', we walked onto the slope to dig a pit.  In 140 cm of snow, we found a Q2 shear, ECTP 15, 75cm from the ground, on very small facets underneath a 1F MF crust.  At 60 cm from the ground, we found another Q2, ECTP 23, failing on similarly small facets beneath what I believe was a pencil hard, 2mm thick rain/rime crust from 2/21 or 2/22.  There was no dirt layer or late-december rain crust at this location.  The snowpit was a couple hundred feet to the north of where this avalanche occurred, and probably 200 vertical feet below the highest portion of the crown, but I am confident the slide ran on one of the shears we found in our snowpit.   Our second, more serious error, was in choosing terrain we had only developed an impression of, without really knowing its characteristics.  No one in our party had been on this slope before yesterday, although one member of the group and I have remarked on previous occasions that it looked like a great run.  Upon reaching the slope yesterday, I thought it looked \\\"low angle,\\\" and several slope angle measurements along the flank of the slope adjacent to our up-track were in the low 30's.  In yesterday's flat light, it was easy to look all the way across the slope without identifying any terrain features that seemed to be likely spots for an avalanche to release.  We projected our slope angle measurements to the open expanse of the slope to our right.  After being highlighted by a large crown and mangled bed surface, a broad, very shallow gully in the middle of the face, just to the skiers left of my intended descent route became obvious.  I consciously took the appearance of a dense thicket of middle-aged aspens directly at the base of the slope to indicate that this slope rarely, if ever slid.  Indeed, it would seem that full-track avalanches on this slope are rare, yet historically occasional events, as just a few, well flagged spruces--with generations of smaller aspen trunks piled up against them--are resident in this stand of forest.\", \"Avalanche Season\": \"Middle\"}, {\"Region\": \"Salt Lake\", \"Month\": 3, \"Day\": 4, \"Year\": 2012, \"Trigger\": \"Skier\", \"WeaK Layer\": \"New Snow/Old Snow Interface\", \"Depth_inches\": 24.0, \"Vertical_inches\": 12000.0, \"Aspect\": \"East\", \"Elevation_feet\": 8100.0, \"Comments 1\": \"Crown ranged from 10\\\"-24\\\" .....200' crown is an estimate.

On the way from East Pass to Davenport Hill, one natural, soft slab avalanche was noted in a steep, north facing gully just skiers left of east pass, which appeared to have run this morning; the 30' wide, ~6\\\" deep crown, and the debris in the runout, was all covered by a few inches of new snow.  Additionally, I triggered an 8\\\" deep, 50' wide new snow, soft slab avalanche, from a safe spot on the ridge, in the next gully to the west, near the top of Davenport Hill.  Both of these slides appeared to have failed beneath the new snow on yesterday's faceted snow surface.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter cresting the top of Davenport hill, the next portion of ridgeline to the west was nearly snow free on the south side of the ridge, and I judged the north side of the ridge to be \\\"not steep enough to be a problem.\\\"  My partner and I stopped for a moment, and I stated my feelings about the slope, and then walked onto it.  Staying very close to the ridge, I immediately felt the sandbox effect of a weak snowpack beneath this morning's snow, and after taking a couple steps, the avalanche broke at my feet.  The slab moved very slowly at first, and I was able to arrest on the bed surface, although the bed surface was so loose that I felt like I was treading water, well after the slab was off to the races below me. \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, the slab was an average of 10\\\"-12\\\" deep, with a couple portions stepping down into the late november facets, and one portion, on the eastern extremety of the slide, releasing near the ground, with the characteristic brown snow visible at the bottom of a ~three foot deep crown.  When I stood up, I measured the slope angle where I stood to be 32 degrees, although other portions of the bed surface measured exactly 36 degrees.  In places, this slab pulled out near the ridge on portions of ~30 degree terrain.  The debris ran through dense trees below me, and well onto the flats beneath the Silver Fork Headwall.  I called my friends in West Bowl who confirmed there was no one else in the area, and then called Alta Central.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a close call--if I had entered the slope further to the east, where it is steeper, I would have been on a deeper portion of the slab and would likely have been strained through dense trees before riding a large debris pile to the flats.  It was similar to what has been, to my knowledge, my only other truly close call, in which I assumed my visual impression of a slope's steepness was correct, without having actually measured it previously, or personally seeing avalanches on the slope.  In both cases, i had made a deliberate assesment of terrain and snow conditions, and judged that I was about to do the right thing.  In both cases, I was in terrain I don't ski that much--not really a silver fork guy--but which I assumed could be navigated safely.

In the first picture of the bigger slide, a snowmobiler was side-hilling at mid elevation on a hill.  On the left side of the slide you can see his tracks coming out of it.  He caused a lower slab to go which started small but then the lower slab caused all of the upper to go including the cornice.  We observed other large bowls with no snowmobile tracks in or out that had gone. This was only one of multiple avalanches we either triggered or observed. The 2nd and 3rd picture is an avalanche that ww triggered remotely from our snowmobiles. We were riding around 40 yards from where the slide actually occurred.  That one slid down to the weeds and covered the trail we had just ridden in on with about 7ft of snow.  Some occurred naturally and others from snowmobiles.  Both obvious and non obvious hills were sliding down to the dirt. In both cases I think the wind was a major factor in that the cornices were huge and the wind had blown large amounts of unstable snow below those cornices.  I believe that the first picture of the bigger slide is the tallest peak in that range so I'm guessing around 10k ft. In all cases we observed the slides went from the ridgeline all the way down. \\r\\n In 20 years of snowmobiling it is by far the worst avalanche conditions I've ever witnessed.

Looked at Scotts peak then decided to look into No Name because we new that was the place with the weakest snow structure, did not note any new activity in the bowl, dropped a few small cornices and only got some shallow new snow sluffs to run. Walked around the corner into the trees and dug a pit, the pit showed only 4 inches of new low density snow sitting on a fragile rain crust, with no slab just loose facets. Went back around the corner to No Name with the intentions of skiing it, noting not much of a new load or any wind effect and new the slope contained basically facets top to bottom with minimal amount or new snow. Brett went in first and noted a little bit if a slab in the very top section but 2 turns in he was in loose facets top to bottom with no slab, he skied the slope without incident. I dropped in next and made what I think was a mistake in judgment, instead of skiing to the skiers right of his tracks which was a bit lower angle, I opted for the steeper roll on skiers left side about 30ft down the slope I saw it fracture about 20ft above me and turned hard right and got off the slab, the slide washed by me and gouged down to the ground running to the transition zone and leaving a nice debris pile at the bottom. Fracture line was 5 to 11\\\" deep.\\u00a0 My thinking is that I hit a thin weak spot in the only place on the whole slope with a small slab on it, and the debris pile was so large because it cleaned out all the hang fire from the last slide I triggered in there a couple weeks ago, and cleaned out all the facets to the ground in the whole path except for the top of the starting zone. It was actually some what of a user friendly slide if that is possible. I think I hit the only sweet spot in the whole bowl that you could trigger an avalanche in.

This time of year I enjoy walking up the west ridge of the Birthday Chutes to the summit of Red Top.  If need-be, a relatively safe descent can be made following the ridge and skinner back to the White Pine road.  There are a couple short, steep pitches one has to navigate before you get on the ridge that I thought would be manageable in the current danger.  We broke trail from the road and the shady snow was good.  Higher, we were skinning up the ridge on generally wind-hammered snow when, at the location of the X in the illustration, I had a crack shoot out from my skis.  I could see that the whole slope to my left had spiderwebbed, but not moved.  As we (party of two) were marveling at the collapse, we saw a powder cloud shoot out from the bottom of the westernmost Bday chute.  It had slid wall-to-wall, to the ground, basically removing the entirely of the snowpack from the length of the chute.  No other chutes slid to our knowledge. The collapse must have propagated 150-200 feet to cause this. The debris piles were large, with big chunks of windboard in it.  As usual, the strong SW winds were loading this slope and I suspect this made the danger locally higher.  In the illustration the blue line is our skinner, the red line outlines the collapsed area, and the red hash indicates areas that slid.  A large area that was probably near 30 deg didn't slide.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing I have been thinking about since the seriously unstable snow last weekend is whether or not one can look at a spiderwebbed slope as being as safe as an avalanched one.  If the fracture has already propagated across it, can you cause an avalanche by then riding it?  My intuition says 99% of the time this is true.  But not 100%.  Is this proof that the slope is not steep enough to slide?  I am guessing that with these slides failing on the ground, the friction of the bed surface is relatively high, and just because the slope didn't totally fail this time, doesn't mean that with a smooth suncrust as a bed surface it might not slide then.  We took the most conservative route down to avoid testing these questions.  Even though we had no intention to ski the Bday chutes, it was still a good scare at the beginning of the season to keep one honest.  The phone was dying so we didn't get but one poor picture that I didn't attach.

The slide broke at his feet on the thin, rocky rollover and looked to have pulled up 150 feet and all the way across Hanky Panky to the far edge of the main Gulley. The slide came in two pieces, two clouds. The skier caught was one of the most experienced backcountry skiers at the Canyons and one of the best skiers.

We had made several runs in a section called \\\"Hanky panky\\\", just north of \\\"movie line trees\\\". As we started migrating more and more skiers left I made the unfortunate decision to ski a line called \\\"goal post\\\". this line runs along a ridge that is more convex and becomes steeper, approaching 42 degrees in spots. My plan was to ski the right side of the subridge and avoid most the steeper more exposed section; giving me an escape route to skiers right. as I skied through the two trees that goal post is named after, I didn't notice any fracturing at the time but the snowpack was noticeably thin and faceted. Visibility was poor, but it is our belief that the avalanche started there in the weaker facets under the new snow, and quickly propagated and stepped down to the ground. It is important to note that the Avalanche didn't strike me like a NFL linebacker till I was 1/2 the way down the slope, leading me to believe that it didn't fracture till I was already well below the starting point. I made a number of mistakes and ignored some obvious red flags over the last couple days. Suspect pits, natural avalanches close by and on similar aspects, noted snow \\\"whomping\\\" and the UAC report, all should have been clear signals to back off.

First skier was not part of group and had center punched steepest section of the bowl. Second skier was at the base of the slope and experience a loud settling and whump.

The slab fractured approx. 100' across the slope to the south-east across the bowl. We reason that the 150' of slope above the trigger point then slid sympathetically. Bed surface was early December snow pack that had decomposed, but was supportable to a persons weight. A bit of stomping on the base surface showed that it was poorly bonded. Approximately 2.5-3' of the snow pack slid, while the total snowpack depth was 4' (Picture 3).

The bottom line is two skiers standing on the Murdock ridge (estimated weight 320 lbs) caused an audible collapse that resulted in a shooting crack on the surface that ran 100 ft east and triggered a sympathetic pocket hardslab avalanche, immediately below the ridgeline, about 25 feet vertical feet below and 100 feet right of us.

Our party of 3 experienced backcountry skiers set out just before 0500, skinned up Argenta, skied a mellow line on the Catcher's mitt, booted up the East Couloir, and opted to ski back down Argenta instead of the East Couloir for much better snow quality. We descended the ridge west from the top of Kessler, careful not to dip into the steep terrain on either side. As I was skiing the trees of the ridge around 10,000ft, I hit a rock garden that had been covered by the new snow. This caused me to lose my ski and fall onto the low 30s degree angle slope which rolled over into a slope which appproached 40 degrees much further downhill. I stood up and began probing for my ski, which appeared to have torpedoed about 5 feet below me. I stepped a few feet below where I had landed--I would guess that the slope was 35 degrees at that point--and felt the slab begin to slide beneath me. It broke out 3-5 feet above where I was standing. Luckily, I was standing by a tree and was able to grab onto a limb, which allowed me to pull myself up while the ground gave way. The other members in my party were luckily still on the ridge and out of the way. The slab was quite cohesive consolidated new snow. The interface at which it slid did not appear faceted or rotten. It broke out around 50 feet across and funneled down over a large cliff. The impact of the avalanche falling over the cliff propagated another slide, with a crown that appeared to be 4-5 feet. I watched from above and shouted warnings as I saw the slides continuing downhill. As we were not sure if anyone had been caught or carried, my two partners left me quickly and found a safe way down to the debris. There they encountered a party of two who watched the slide and did not believe there were any other parties ascending or descending between us. My partners performed a beacon search and found no buried persons. \\r\\nAs one of my partner's phone was dead and the other on airplane mode, I no longer had contact with them and I did not know whether there were any injured parties. As such, I snapped a few quick pictures of the crown, but did not have time to thoroughly investigate it. I descended via the skin track on one ski until I reached mellower terrain (apologies to anyone skinning up later...). I reached my partners at the base of the debris and saw that the other two parties were approaching the lower, 4-5 foot crown to investigate (perhaps they will post photos). \\r\\n\\r\\nNote: if anyone finds a BD Amperage ski with Dynafit bindings in the debris, I would love it back. Please contact UAC if found. Beer and good karma in it for you!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy take on the incident:\\r\\nThe same three skiers in our party lapped Cardiff peak yesterday and noticed some mild sluffing underfoot and also visualized moderate soft slab natural avalanches on two trees. We were aware of the rapid loading which took place and knew the avi forecast well, and knew that there was potential for activity today. We checked out the dawn patrol forecast and were aware of the recent natural avalanche cycles down south and potential for slab activity on steep north-facing slopes. We planned to ski the Catcher's Mitt and did so at the lower angle route. We planned to ride the ridge from Kessler west until we reached more moderate terrain before dropping in. I had no intentions of skiing where the avalanche occurred. I was incredibly fortunate to have a tree beside me which I was able to grab onto. Otherwise I may well have ended up at the bottom of a very large cliff. I did not expect the new snow interface to give so easily and on a relatively moderate roll-over, but the steeper terrain below the rollover was sufficient to release the slab. I considered the risk of descending another few feet to retrieve my ski, and felt that an avalanche was highly unlikely based on this action. I was wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nLessons: We saw red flags today: recent loading, evidence of natural avalanches out in the distance in Broad's fork. There was no collapsing or cracking that I noticed, and no slides apart from gentle sluffs and warm releases of of Kessler. I knew there were pockets of considerable and unfortunately I literally fell right into one. It turns out that trying to make smart decisions with regards to route choice only works most of the time, and you need to be prepared for the worst and hope to get lucky if badness happens.\\r\\nOne of my partner's injured her knee in the backcountry a couple months ago and required extrication. A few of us were able to splint her leg, keep her warm, and extricate her using skins, skis, cordelette, athletic and duct tape, and Voile-style ski straps. Because of accidents like that, I always carry extra layers, an emergency bivy, ski straps, tape, and pain meds. I feel that had there been an injury or burial, my party would have been prepared to respond.\\r\\nOne thing that could have gone better, however, is communication. With phones not working, it was impossible to communicate. This underscores the essential need to carry either a phone or radio that is functional. UAC's iPhone App was awesome for pulling up Alta Central and UAC numbers to report the incident.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks to UAC for all your life-saving work.\", \"Avalanche Season\": \"Middle\"}, {\"Region\": \"Skyline\", \"Month\": 3, \"Day\": 4, \"Year\": 2015, \"Trigger\": \"Skier\", \"WeaK Layer\": \"Facets\", \"Depth_inches\": 30.0, \"Vertical_inches\": 6000.0, \"Aspect\": \"Northeast\", \"Elevation_feet\": 10300.0, \"Comments 1\": \"General observations included here as well as avalanche info.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo feet plus of new snow on the Manti Skyline out of this recent storm.\\u00a0 We hadn't been down for a number of weeks now so we needed to approach things cautiously to see what was going on with the new snow.\\u00a0 It was very deep and almost too deep to travel.\\u00a0 There was way too much snow to get into some of our favorite bowls right off the get-go so we started out on low angled west facing terrain, not steep enough to slide.\\r\\n\", \"Avalanche Season\": \"Middle\"}, {\"Region\": \"Salt Lake\", \"Month\": 3, \"Day\": 4, \"Year\": 2015, \"Trigger\": \"Skier\", \"WeaK Layer\": \"Facets\", \"Depth_inches\": 30.0, \"Vertical_inches\": 4800.0, \"Aspect\": \"North\", \"Elevation_feet\": 10200.0, \"Comments 1\": \"Got to the top of the ridge sometime between 10:15 and 10:45.

Our party of two was skiing north from the west shoulder of Lookout Peak above Pinecrest. We'd spent most of the day skiing further west on the ridgeline. The snowpack that direction was fairly dense, with the new snow having settled significantly. We did not see any significant cracking, sluffs, or collapsing. As the afternoon went on the weather turned worse, with winds from the SE picking up along the ridge line. Heading up the shoulder of Lookout Peak we encountered a party of 4 and could see the skin track of another party of two ahead of us. A short distance west of the summit we transitioned and decided to ski the trees to the north. We did notice some wind slabs that cracked fairly easily on the ridge, but that was not present just below. A little ways down there is a rollover to the left, and a less steep glade to the right. I went right, the skiing was excellent in there, much lighter than farther down the ridge. Upon stopping around 300' down I Iooked back to my skiers left and saw the crown of a soft slab that had broken right down to the ground interface at the point of the rollover. I thought at first that I'd triggered it remotely. My partner arrived shortly after and moving over to the slide path we called out and got a response from a party of two. They said they were OK, but the person caught had lost both skis. They were working on making their way back up with the party behind trying to walk on the tails of the other's skis. We turned around and cut a skin track back to the ridge along a more mellow angle. During this time the party of 4 came upon the scene and they feared we had been caught and buried -- all accounted for and no injuries we continued to the ridge. The party of four attempted to search the debris field for the missing skis, but felt a significant collapse, and exited. From the ridge two of that party had the good idea of taking my skis back down. Two of us stayed on the ridge line, the rest went back down to reach the party of two and guide them back up our skin track. Winds continued to increase, there was definitely snow moving to the leeward north slope, which may have been a contributing factor in the slide. Ultimately, all parties reached the ridge. The party of two caught in the slide decided to go one ski each and make their way down that way. Meanwhile another group was coming up from pinecrest with a pair of skis. We continued with them to a sheltered point just before you head down into the pinecrest gully. That's where we left the group. We met the party headed up with the extra skis on the way down. Just one picture of the slide crown, but you can see it broke down to the facets on the ground. Glad no one was hurt.

carried, buried, injured or killed\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Comments: We got away with a very bad decision today without suffering any consequences.\\u00a0 After multiple great runs on Chicken Shit Ridge (CSR), we decided to exit via the skier's left side of Days Draw.\\u00a0 We knew it had run to the ground Dec. 23rd and there were still weak facets.\\u00a0 Our thinking was there was about 2 feet of snow sitting on top of the ground and there was no evidence of a slab.\\u00a0 There was no wind effect on any of the snow in the area and we had seen no cracking or settlement or any other signs of instability.\\u00a0 There were two sets of tracks from the previous day on the right side of Days Draw.\\u00a0 By the end of the day, the 9 people from 3 parties had made a lot of tracks on CSR, so the uncut snow on Days Draw was very appealing.\\u00a0 We have skied this slope many many times over the years and knew the terrain very well.\\u00a0 We discussed the potential risks and decided to proceed.\\u00a0 As you can see/hear in the video, our biggest concern was hitting rocks in the shallow snow near the top of the run.\\u00a0 We thought we might get some loose snow sluffs but expected them to be manageable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nI went first and hit a rock on my second and 4th turns.\\u00a0 When I was about 200 vertical feet down the slope I saw the slope begin to shatter like a window pane beneath my skis and to my left.\\u00a0 I skied off to the right and stopped.\\u00a0 The avalanche released about 100-150 vertical feet above me, was about 70-100 feet wide and it rocketed down the slope which is about 35-38 degrees in that area.\\u00a0 The upper-most crown was on a slight convex part of the slope.\\u00a0 The ground and some remaining old facets were the bed surface.\\u00a0 It entrained quite a bit of snow, gathered a lot of speed and plowed into the trees below.\\u00a0 It plastered some of the tree trunks to a height of about 6 feet (see photo) and ran 450 vertical feet down the slope.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the place where I stopped the snow did not go downhill, but there were numerous cracks in the snow.\\u00a0 After the avalanche went by, I immediately traversed onto the bed surface of rocks and old facets.\\u00a0 I could see there really wasn't much snow left above me so I felt safe on the bed surface.\\u00a0 Between me and the top of the slope was mostly rocks, so my two companions could not descend the bed surface to me, and we felt the snow that had not slid yet, was very likely to slide if they attempted to descend in the snow adjacent to the avalanche path.\\u00a0 My companions put their skins back on and walked back to the top of the ridge and descended CSR.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom where I was standing I could see the slide had run all the way to a bench a few hundred vertical feet below me.\\u00a0 I knew there was little avalanche danger on the much more gentle terrain below the bench and felt that it was safer for me to descend than to attempt to gain the ridge through the hang fire and rocks.\\u00a0 I side slipped and skied the bed surface and debris to the bench and then skied to the bottom and met my companions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\u2019ve included a photo of the crown, a photo of the bed surface which was mostly rocks and facets, a photo looking down the path at the snow plastered on some trees, a photo looking across the width of the slide, and a photo of the toe located 450 vertical feet below the crown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nThe avalanche is very difficult to see in the video, but the 1 minute video does provide some sense for how far down the slope I was when the avalanche broke out above me. \\u00a0In the video, you can see when I stopped skiing as the slope was breaking up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, we completely underestimated the likelihood of a slab on this slope and I\\u2019m feeling very fortunate we didn\\u2019t suffer any consequences for our poor judgement.\", \"Avalanche Season\": \"Middle\"}, {\"Region\": \"Logan\", \"Month\": 1, \"Day\": 19, \"Year\":

About 1/3-1/2 way down the slope, he began rising up what felt like 10 feet in the air.

A group of skiers who had ascended earlier in the day were heading down as we were heading up the skin track and they skied the slope bellow blue ice quickly as well. After crossing the tree patch and continuing on to the roll over that constitutes the upper basin of Broads Fork I looked back and saw that a glide avalanche had broken loose and covered the skin track and the skier tracks under blue ice. I was able to see large blocks still tumbling and the debris settling into the slope we had just crossed. This is one of those experiences that has been best described as we got away with one.

I've had good early season success skiing that there, so we skinned up to the top of Collins to scout it, and thinking it looked relatively filled in, decided to climb up to the top of Mt. Baldy for Main Chute via Sugarloaf Pass. At the top, there was obvious wind loading on the line, but the pillow of wind loaded snow looked relatively shallow, isolated and manageable. We did not see any other tracks around the area leading to the chute or apron, so I decided to drop in and do a ski cut. A soft storm/light wind slab pulled out at my feet ripping across the length of the chute 8 to 10 inches deep. It continued down the length of the line, propagating along the width of the chute on its way down. It started slowly, and looked like it would stop, so I was surprised to see it pick up steam on the way down. I knew there had been some wind loading, but I thought the ski cut would result in a more isolated pocket pulling out. The snowpack had a bit of an upside down feeling to it. We continued down the chute, and for the first few turns, the bed surface was consolated snow that was skiable. Then, halfway down, the bed surface became more sugary, unconsoladated snow and quite rocky. Perhaps we were overly optimistic about the amount and density of new snow in the Wasatch when we decided to drop into Main Chute this morning, but I felt able to manage the ski cut and the risk appropriately. It's always a good reminder to ensure that there is no one below you when you do a ski cut at a heavily trafficed area (we were certain that there was no one in the line when we dropped in, but Main Chute has a blind turn in the middle, so we couldn't see the apron and runout zone.)

The weak layer was a layer of Graupel between the bottom layer of the slab and the Bed Surface. There was a lot of graupel with the snow that fell Thursday into Friday. The bed surface was a thin crust that was very easy to break through. After our last storm the winds shifted and blew out of the NE, and I believe these winds are responsible for the thin crust that served as the bed surface. In my report yesterday I noted sensitive snow on this face as we walked the ridge line and experienced collapsing with loud whoomphs. We remotely triggered another part of the slope higher up the ridge on our second lap. As you are about to top out on the peak there is an island of trees on the ridge maybe 50 feet down off the peak.

The\\u00a0snowpack\\u00a0in that path was roughly 70-90 cm so the rain percolated through to the ground quickly.

Graupel was falling, accumulating anywhere from 0 to perhaps 8 cm deep, with variations due to wind transport.  A stout, 1 cm, rain crust existed above about 9200 feet that was extremely slick.  We skinned up low-angle terrain beneath Toledo Bowl. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt about 9500 feet (thumbnail F above), we decided not to go higher into steeper terrain and to return to Alta.  As my partner descended the slope just to skiers left (east) of the pucker trees, a slough broke out on a slope that we measured later at 20 degrees.  The slough continued down slope and I shouted to my partner who skied right into the pucker trees as the slough continued its slow march downslope, eventually descending into Toledo Gully.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe continued slowly working our way downhill, encountering a solo skier who eventually skied ahead of us and encountered a debris pile where Toledo Gully crosses the jeep road and traditional skin track to Cardiff Pass.  The solo skier told us he witnessed no other skiers in the vicinity, but he skied ahead of us and wisely did a beacon search where there was a debris pile at the skin/track jeep trail, finding no signals.  We then caught up to him, had a quick discussion, and the solo skier went down perhaps 100 vertical feet further to the toe and did another search, again finding no signals.  My partner and I repeated both searches just to be sure, then returned to Alta and reported the slide to UDOT.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhotos below illustrate the remarkably low angle nature of the starting zone of this slide and how it ultimately descended into and down Toledo Gulch.  My partner is near the toe of the slide in the final photo, with a debris pile more than deep enough to bury someone.  A stout rain crust served as an extremely slick bed will likely be a problem tomorrow as well.

We climbed the sub-ridge\\u00a0and commented on how there were some small wind slabs that had formed. There were only ~2\\\" deep and the snow was quite dense under these (it was difficult to sink a pole in). After descending the next wave of the storm moved in socking in Cardiac Bowl in a thick fog. We traversed towards Superior with the plan to ski the south face back to the road. We knew there had been an accident on the south aspect on Wednesday, but other than the small wind slabs from the prior climb, we had not seen any red flags on the north\\u00a0aspects. We ascended Cardiac Bowl with the plan to gain the ridge up the east chute. The snow was dense and supportable. We had not had any cracking or collapsing, and the east winds had not appeared to have loaded the mid-bowl. We were skinning about 20' apart from each other and when we were ~50' from the ridge, we felt the collapse as the slope broke 30' above us 8\\\" deep\\u00a0and propagated 150' wide. 30-40' below the crown, the slide stepped down to the next weak layer forming a smaller, secondary crown. The dense snow knocked both of us over and slowly carried us down with it. We attempted to self-arrest, but the bed surface was too soft for a whippet to stick. Both of us rode the slide down 400' before being able to arrest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nCurious to understand what happened and what clues we missed, we ascended the bed surface to evaluate both crowns.

It may have simply been a poor bond underneath the new snow that fell December 12th-14th.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nThe photo below shows Tuesday's avalanche and obvious wind drifting of snow (photo - Park City Ski Patrol).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Friday, December 12, an avalanche was spotted to the north.

Our plan was to traverse from the low angle terrain\\u00a0over to the ridge line and follow the ridge to the exit. The traverse portion would expose us for a\\u00a0short time with lower consequence.\\u00a0We came to the first path a little too\\u00a0low, exposing us to more of the slope than we expected.\\u00a0When we got there, my partner asked if this was still a good idea. She said the slope seemed wind\\u00a0loaded, rather than skin back up the 250 ft and traverse over a small distance we decided to traverse the slope where we were, one at a time. When she was about 5 feet onto the slope, I told her\\u00a0she needed to point more down hill to get momentum. The second she did I heard a very loud crack (this was not a whumpf). The slope shattered\\u00a0about 150 feet above her. I could see the crown line propagate\\u00a0down slope\\u00a0about 5 feet in front\\u00a0of me and then run another 200ft down slope.\\u00a0I screamed GO GO GO! She pointed down hill and started pole planting to get off the slope as it shattered around her. Thankfully, she was able to ski off the slope.

We had seen a small slide in an ENE aspect under a rock band on the way up to our final descent. Upon reaching the before-mentioned traverse, I was tired and ready to get home. The light was getting a little flat at that moment, but still as I came around the corner and saw some signs of definite wind loading I became instantly nervous. Knowing myself and how easily I tend to get spooked, I asked my partner if this was still a good idea. He had no concerns as this is a slope we have skied many times and we\\u2019ve never seen run (I know, heuristic traps all around). I decided, I must just be overreacting and chose\\u00a0to trust my partner\\u2019s observations and go for the traverse instead of making us both skin up and around the ridge line. My partner reminded me to go fast and not stop for any reason which I dually noted. As I started out onto the slope, he suggested I angle more downhilll to get more speed across the exposed terrain. As I pointed more downhill, I felt a slight whumpf and my partner screamed at me to go, go, go! I knew instantly from his tone that I must have triggered an avalanche and was in immediate danger. As I skied as fast as I could using my poles and all the gusto I could muster, I glanced over my left shoulder at the snow moving downhill toward me. I was lucky, I made it to the safe zone without being caught, carried, or even feeling the snow moving under me. My partner later informed me that as the slide ripped out it sounded like a gunshot and the snow under my skis was, in fact starting to move.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy takeaway is to listen to my gut and trust my instincts. I have a tendency to get nervous and choose to be overly cautious in most situations, especially in avalanche terrain. As such, I have learned to lean on the opinions and experience of others a bit too much, especially when touring with people I know so well and trust.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, side note: Hats off to the small group that stopped and checked on us from the safety of the ridge-line. We are all accepting risks by going in to the backcountry and it\\u2019s important that we all be aware and have each others\\u2019 backs.\", \"Avalanche Season\": \"Middle\"}, {\"Region\": \"Logan\", \"Month\": 2, \"Day\": 17, \"Year\": 2020, \"Trigger\": \"Snowmobiler\", \"WeaK Layer\": \"Facets\", \"Depth_inches\": 14.0, \"Vertical_inches\": 4200.0, \"Aspect\": \"East\", \"Elevation_feet\": 8900.0, \"Comments 1\": \"Tim sent this picture via instagram.

I was part of the party that triggered the slide. We stayed up in the area on Sunday and night. We watched it snow all afternoon. and then headed it out right before sunset to check out what the wind was doing on the ridge on the northside of White pine canyon, East of Boiler.\\u00a0 The wind was nuking. 30 - 40 mph gusts. Lots of snow moving around.\\u00a0 We kicked some cornices on a test slope and it was very reactive, propagated nicely. The E - NE aspects were active. Once you got straight north, we could not get anything to move. But it was just the wind transported snow. A layer of about 3-4 inches. The wind howled all night where we were staying and blew in all our tracks overnight\\u00a0and quit about 5am.\\u00a0\\r\\nMonday morning we headed toward Boiler bowl and ran into the Amy and Eric making laps on Burner run. Exchanged observations, discussed conditions and were not planning on dropping into Boiler but wanted to check out what was happing. So we walked the ridge and kicked cornices and saw no reaction. Not even shooting cracks., which surprised us based off of what we saw the night before. We could also see small pockets that had ripped out during the storm in the east-facing aspect of the Boiler.\\u00a0\\r\\nWe discussed the risks heavily and possible scenarios, and after a lot of discussion, it was decided the probability of triggering a windslab was considerable, the consequences and size of a slide\\u00a0were lower.\\u00a0 One member of our party decided he was willing to take that risk and picked a conservative line down. He ski cut the top to a tree island. Right across a\\u00a0wind slab. We saw no cracks or settling from his ski cut. He took a couple more turns hugging the tree island. On the second turn, right where the slope rolls over to the steepest pitch (37 degrees) the fracture shot out to the right about 100 feet and started to move. The skier was is a very favorable position and easily turned off the slab right below the tree island. The slide ran slow. Almost like a wet slide. The crown was about 12 inches at the tallest point. The majority of it was probably 8 inches.\\u00a0\\r\\nThe skier traversed the debris which was still soft to the right side of the bowl\\u00a0and skinned back up to the ridge through the trees. See the pictures for the moments it fractured and the aftermath.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nI am feeling a little guilty about the process as we were presented with obvious red flags the night before and then sucked into the good looking slope with the sunshine and the lack of signs once we were standing on top. Especially because we have all skied that bowl a lot over the past 20 years and know what it is capable of. So maybe the familiarity with the area played a factor as well. I think the other idea that played a role\\u00a0was\\u00a0that if it slid, it would not be large. We were pretty confident that the wind slab was not deep and there was a very low risk of a bigger deep slab instability.\\u00a0 Either way, we definitely crossed a line and are lucky it ended up the way it did.

There was about 4 inches of fresh snow on the debris at 8 am. There were a wide assortment of crowns, with depths ranging from 1 to about 4 ft and massive amounts of debris in the main section of the run. Aspects ranged from NW to N to NE. Debris was piled up down to nearly the thick aspens where the slope flattens. Many tracks from yesterday were covered and much of the popular run was bed surface now under 4 inches of fresh snow. There were numerous fir trees broken off, up to about 8 inches in diameter. The traditional skin track was hit in a few places and some of the paths were repeaters from earlier in the season. There was still some hang fire and we had no inclination to climb up to look at the starting zones. Our travel also took us to the area approaching Mt Raymond, below Raymond Glade, and we saw evidence of a large slide that appeared to come from the NW side of Mt Raymond, past the bottom of Piece of Pie, with debris reaching to the flat at the bottom of the small fir trees at about 8600 ft on the approach to Mt Raymond from the Main Porter Fork trail. It was noteworthy that there was evidence of a lot of skier traffic on Saturday. Since most of the popular skiable terrain was overun by the avalanche(s), it's a safe assumption that we dodged a bullet yesterday - waiting until late at night to slide was a stroke of good luck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(A. Bellomy):\\u00a0\\r\\nTwo very large natural avalanches along the headwall of West Porter Fork. The debris ran for approximately 1,800 vertical feet and 3/4 of a mile in distance. Dozens of ski tracks from the previous days and a few sections of the previous skin track were covered in debris. Trees up to 12\\\" thick were snapped in half and scattered throughout the debris. The only portion of the headwall that did not avalanche in this cycle had previously slid naturally about two weeks ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was about 5\\\" inches of new snow on the debris which leads me to believe that it ran yesterday afternoon or early evening when the PI increased. There were various crown lines. Some that were 2.5-3.5 ft deep and a few places where it stepped all the way to the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: I don't want to get on too much of a soap box, but this was a real eye opener for me. West Porter has grown in popularity over the last few years and a lot of people treat it as if it is a safe place to ski on higher avy danger days (myself included, admittedly). It is understandable because the main ski line is a very low angle and there are thick trees between the headwall and the main ski line. However, the reality is that West Porter has SIGNIFICANT overhead hazard from the surrounding headwall. Once you are above 8,200 feet you are exposed on three sides to a potential avalanche from above that can run through the trees and hit you on the skin track or ski lines. This is not a place I would recommend skiing on days of considerable or high avalanche danger.\", \"Avalanche Season\": \"Middle\"}, {\"Region\": \"Salt Lake\", \"Month\": 2, \"Day\": 13, \"Year\": 2021, \"Trigger\": \"Natural\", \"WeaK Layer\": \"Unknown\", \"Depth_inches\": 36.0, \"Vertical_inches\": 15000.0, \"Aspect\": \"East\", \"Elevation_feet\": 10600.0, \"Comments 1\": \"I'm declining to include a weak layer on this observation because the light was not outstanding and the avalanche had a bit of new snow on top when we observed\\u00a0it from Toledo saddle at about 2 PM today.

Judging from the size of this fracture, and the evident debris pile at the bottom of this area, this fracture\\u00a0was approximately 2 to 3 feet deep at the crown, and propagated about 150 feet to skiers left, as there are related\\u00a0fractures visible to viewers right in the photos; and it ran about 1200 feet through thick trees, ending in a deposition pile in a large gully\\u00a0known as \\\"the Cemetery\\\".\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\n3. There are ski tracks above the fracture. I don't know if this was a natural or skier-triggered, but as it was the only slide in the area, and some of the only tracks in the area were directly above the fracture, it is possible it was skier-triggered.\", \"Avalanche Season\": \"Middle\"}, {\"Region\": \"Skyline\", \"Month\": 2, \"Day\": 17, \"Year\": 2021, \"Trigger\": \"Natural\", \"WeaK Layer\": \"Facets\", \"Depth_inches\": 36.0, \"Vertical_inches\": 2400.0, \"Aspect\": \"Northwest\", \"Elevation_feet\": 9100.0, \"Comments 1\": \"Came across this natural avalanche on the lower slopes of Knob Mountain.

The terrain where it happened consists of a maybe 600 vertical foot headwall that is sparsely treed narrowing to a gully that runs for 2,500 vertical feet. This is a pretty rarely skied area, and is a quite massive slide path that seems to run big regularly. There was evidence of a very large avalanche presumably from early January that snapped many trees and ran full track, producing a massive, probably 15-20 foot deep debris pile at its toe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nI was skiing in a group of three, and we were using this run as an exit run late in the afternoon after skiing several runs on Santaquin. We all congregated at a safe spot on the ridge the top of the run, with a great visual of the entire slope (see attached photo.) With my partners watching I dropped into the run, skiing the headwall somewhat fast and aggressively. The snow was untracked and consisted of very deep near surface facets untouched by the wind and was excellent skiing. I slowed down as the terrain narrowed into a gully, and was hit with what felt like a wall of snow. I fought hard to self arrest, sliding with my feet facing downhill and arms digging in to the bed surface. I very briefly was buried and then came up to the surface again, and was just barely able to stop myself. Before I could breathe a sigh of relief I was hit by another wave, got carried again and can't remember if this one ever buried me but I was able to self-arrest more quickly this time. I then deployed the airbag on my pack in case another wave hit and skied to the side so I was out of the line of fire. I was probably carried a max of about 100 vertical feet but was barely able to self arrest and felt like I could have easily been carried much further.\\u00a0I lost a pole in the slide (but found it about 1,000 vertical feet lower) and sustained no injuries. The slide path was mostly clean but there was a rock band quite a bit lower that could have easily caused an injury had I been carried over it. I was shocked by how much snow there was and how fast it moved considering it was entirely my sluff that started following me as soon as I dropped into the line.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nTakeaways:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\n1). We didn't respect the terrain and did not discuss potential hazards of skiing this particular line. Due to perceived low avalanche danger we didn't perform many of our usual protocols for skiing in avalanche terrain. A simple ski cut likely would have made me aware of this problem, instead I charged straight into the line. On a similar note, either checking over my shoulder or just checking up on the side before the run narrowed likely would have made this a non-issue. I definitely feel like I let my guard down big time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\n2). We had skied two other runs previously, on\\u00a0NW and N aspects and sluffing was only a minor concern. Additionally we have done quite a bit of skiing these past few weeks and any encounters with this snow stability problem were very manageable and unremarkable.\\u00a0While similar in steepness to our previous runs, our last run was quite a bit more radical in terms of terrain features and runout zones.\\u00a0Additionally the snowpack was much shallower due to the large January avalanche and this may have contributed to the snow being even more faceted and weak.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\n3). Radios may have helped in this situation. My partner yelled at me when he saw what was happening but I was already too far down the slope and couldn't hear him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nI was amazed at the sheer volume of snow that came down solely from my sluff. While being a somewhat unusal problem with our faceted snowpack it is definitely something that I will be much more vigilant about going forwards.

We took a lower angled but brushy approach. We skied a couple of slopes below 30 degrees. Rather than climb back up to exit lower angle slopes we mistakenly decided to ski a steeper slope that we had skied several times this season. The first skier skied 6-8 turns to an island of safety and then the second skier joined the first. The third skier came down from above us to skiers left and skied the slope without incident to a lower ridge which is usually safe. The second skier then followed him down. On his third turn the slope fractured 100' above him and began to move. The first skier\\u00a0yelled avalanche and instructed the second skier to go left. At the same time the slope to the\\u00a0right fractured and slid to the ground. Another slope to our left also released and slid\\u00a0about the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second skier\\u00a0was knocked down and I lost sight of him in a cloud of snow as he was carried downhill. I followed him visually down the slope from where I lost sight of him. I yelled to our other partner that I couldn't see him hoping he had a visual. Then I\\u00a0spotted him a couple of hundred feet below me, on a ledge near the left edge of the debris pile,\\u00a0as the snow stopped moving. He lost both skis and broke both safety straps. He took a beating as he was carried through maple and scrub oak.\\u00a0He was pinned to the ground by dense snow around\\u00a0his pack\\u00a0unable\\u00a0to move until he unbuckled his pack. He stood up and found one ski nearby\\u00a0and I located the other ski above him\\u00a0in\\u00a0some scrub oak.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe described being caught and carried,\\u00a0tumbling\\u00a0in the snow seeing nothing but white until he came to a stop on the surface. He was pummeled by snow and branches as he was carried down the slope. No major injuries occurred but he will be bruised and pulled a hamstring. He thought he was taking his last breath and so did I. It's not a good feeling. We were lucky he was ok and able to ski out. The ridge we skied out was noted to crack more than 20 times on our exit but wasn't steep enough to slide.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat did we do wrong?

On our way up, we dug a snowpit to test stability and found no deep instabilities in the snow structure. As we approached the ridge of Kessler we noticed a lot of wind coming over the ridge and depositing on the North face. We did some stability stomps and were unable to get anything to propagate or observe any shooting cracks. As we traversed from the summit of Kessler to the entrance of the line, we started noticing cross loading beneath the top of the couloir which was causing some strange wind pockets and small cornices. To test the stability of the cross loaded surface, I stood back and stomped at the base of a cornice about the size of a small fridge. The cornice broke and dropped onto the slope without causing any propagation on the slope below. Outside the cross loading, the majority of the wind gusts were coming up the couloir and depositing snow onto the East Face of Kessler.

While skinning up towards Pole-line/Cardiff pass, we noticed a small avalanche on the southwest side of the Flagstaff shoulder\\u00a0with one ski track entering the crown, and we were unable to see any ski tracks exiting the debris or slope. We shifted directions towards the avalanche, and once at the bottom still could not see any tracks exiting. Despite the small size of the avalanche, we were concerned about a potential hangup in the trees within the path for the involved party. We decided to send two from our group of 5 up to perform a transceiver signal search because it appeared that the individual may have been traveling alone. The remaining group members\\u00a0stayed in the flats, keeping eyes on the hanging snow above, and called Alta Central\\u00a0to inform them of the situation, so Alta Ski Patrol\\u00a0could standby if the signal search yielded results. We turned our beacons to search at the\\u00a0toe of the debris, and continued to switchback up the slope, spacing out ~50 feet.

Given the traversing nature of the track, it was almost impossible to see from a downhill angle. At this point, we put our transceivers back into send, and communicated the info back down to the rest of our party below so they could communicate back to Alta Central. Out of an abundance of caution, we sent one skier up to the uppermost trees, the last point where anyone involved in the avalanche could have been pinned. It seemed that the involved party had indeed arrested, pinned, or otherwise stopped against these trees, and then skied out. Hard to tell exactly, but this is my best guess. From here I traversed over to the crown to perform a quick profile, then skied back down to the rest of the group. Picture of the trees from uphill included below.

From the ridge summit of Aspens, around 8800 feet, I noticed a large southeast-facing slide off of the West Willow Ridgeline into Mule Hollow. I've skied that aspect and area several times this year, but in less sensitive snowpack conditions, and was personally surprised to see a slide there, especially since the WBSkiing app has this area labeled white, aka not steep enough to slide. It's a good lesson to use the app only as general guideline when observing slope aspects and steepness.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I had to guess, I'd say the slide is a few hundred feet long and wide, and several feet deep. Based on where I was standing on the lower ridge summit below, I'd guess the cause was natural due to heavy wind loading from the most recent storm, and that this slide probably happened over the weekend. I did not notice any tracks going in, or near, the slide path, so I did not feel it was necessary to ski into Mule Hollow and do a proper beacon search.

Had a route planned to climb and to ski what\\u00a0we believed to be safe and protected from the recent winds. We had discussed the possible danger, and wind slabs were the top of the list to look out for. The planned climbing route is one I had used a few times in years past, but had most often used as a descent route. As I was climbing I noticed the wind cross loading slopes well above us, and we discussed the route that we planned to ski as it may have been in that zone. But we did not discuss the climbing route as we were not seeing much wind transport in that area.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nThe initial ascent route was in a tight creek bottom. Anything with some south aspect had rollerballed and had a stout crust from the day before. Just a few feet away north facing felt soft, with a slight density inversion 6-8\\\" down. The skin track varied from crust stout enough to not break through, up to 8 inches of ski penetration. The light was very flat, and it was difficult to tell uphill\\u00a0from down in many places and slope steepness was hard to judge. This led to the mistake of being on this slope.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom looking at the map earlier in the tour, I had planned to be up out of the creek bottom and onto a north facing bench sooner, But with very few visual clues and the intense snowfall rate, I had missed this turn. As we were skinning up the drainage, I noticed the slope get steeper but struggled to plan the track due to the flat light. I could see some brush ahead and misestimated the slope angle between myself and the brush. As I climbed towards it, it became too steep to skin that direction so I stopped to kick turn to my right. As I completed my kick turn I heard a loud crack and the slope started to move.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I had already changed direction my ski started to turn downhill and I was able to stay *mostly* on top of the debris. My partner, who was still facing uphill as the slide started, was sucked backwards, skis pulling under. I yelled for him to swim right as I was getting ready to go over the top of him. Luckily, the slope angle had gently backed off and the slide started to slow. When the snow stopped moving, I was able to take off skis and stand up. My partner was partially buried, waist deep with his head facing uphill, but downhill from his skis. His skis\\u00a0were under enough snow that I had to dig them out to release his bindings.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nThe maximum crown depth was three feet, and averaged around 18 inches. Crown was 45-50 feet wide and total slide distance from crown to toe was\\u00a0about 60 feet. The wind slab was very cohesive and stayed in large blocks through the avalanche. It entrained a shocking amount of snow for the size. The crown was on a slope angle of 35 degrees, and broke about 5 feet above us, right at a convex roll.\\u00a0The angle of the slope at the toe was 20 degrees.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were very lucky that this happened on a slope with overall convexity with the slope angle backing off gently. Many places in the creek bottom we we're traveling through had sharp concave sections that could easily have been terrain traps. I am disappointed that I underestimated the amount of snow that had been loading in this zone over the previous days. Being fairly low elevation and in a tight drainage I mistakenly thought that the area hadn't seen much wind. I am also disappointed that I failed to recognize the windslab, and mistook it for a supportable crust. I don't think I had on my \\\"avalanche eyes\\\" at this point due to complacency and ease of travel. Had I been paying better attention to the route, and doing small checks of the snow along the way, I may have seen earlier signs of slab.

All of us at the Utah Avalanche Center has had our own close calls and know how easy it is to make mistakes. Here are some take-a-ways from this accident:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBoth brothers carried an avalanche transceiver, shovel, and probe, along with airbag backpacks and radios for communication.\\r\\n\\tSnowmobiles are very useful tools during an avalanche rescue because they allow someone to cover long distances quickly; however, they also cause electro-magnetic interference with transceivers. Identifying and mitigating this interference is crucial. The current recommendation is to be 3 meters away from a snowmobile when searching. They can be used in the signal search phase of a rescue, but you need to stop occasionally move 3 meters away from the snowmobile. If there is no signal, return to the sled and change locations.\\r\\n\\tAvalanche airbags can limit burial depth but are much less effective in terrain traps. Additionally, terrain traps tend to cause deep burials because the avalanche debris often accumulates deeper than it would otherwise. Deep burials are very hard to survive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAvalanche probes are delicate pieces of equipment and most are generally less than 3 meters long. One piece of equipment the group found very valuable was a Pieps iProbe, an electronic probe that can detect a transceiver signal. Without having a probe strike for some time, this tool helped direct their digging efforts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAlways only to expose one person to avalanche terrain at one time.
